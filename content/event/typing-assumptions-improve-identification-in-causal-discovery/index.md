title: Typing Assumptions Improve Identification in Causal Discovery
abstract: (From CLeaR) Causality is a fundamental notion in science and
  engineering. In the past few decades, some of the most influential
  developments in the study of causal discovery, causal inference, and the
  causal treatment of machine learning have resulted from cross-disciplinary
  efforts. In particular, a number of machine learning and statistical analysis
  techniques have been developed to tackle classical causal discovery and
  inference problems. On the other hand, the causal view has been shown to be
  able to facilitate formulating, understanding, and tackling a number of hard
  machine learning problems in transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and
  deep learning.
