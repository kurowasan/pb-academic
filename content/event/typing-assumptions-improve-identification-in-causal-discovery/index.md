title: Typing Assumptions Improve Identification in Causal Discovery
abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is a challenging task to
  which an exact solution cannot always be identified. Under assumptions about
  the data-generative process, the causal graph can often be identified up to an
  equivalence class. Proposing new realistic assumptions to circumscribe such
  equivalence classes is an active field of research. In this work, we propose a
  new set of assumptions that constrain possible causal relationships based on
  the nature of the variables. We thus introduce typed directed acyclic graphs,
  in which variable types are used to determine the validity of causal
  relationships. We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that the
  proposed assumptions can result in significant gains in the identification of
  the causal graph.
