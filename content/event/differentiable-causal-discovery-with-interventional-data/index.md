title: Differentiable Causal Discovery with Interventional Data
abstract: Learning a causal directed acyclic graph from data is a challenging
  task that involves solving a combinatorial problem for which the solution is
  not always identifiable. A new line of work reformulates this problem as a
  continuous constrained optimization one, which is solved via the augmented
  Lagrangian method. However, most methods based on this idea do not make use of
  interventional data, which can significantly alleviate identifiability issues.
  This work constitutes a new step in this direction by proposing a
  theoretically-grounded method based on neural networks that can leverage
  interventional data. We illustrate the flexibility of the
  continuous-constrained framework by taking advantage of expressive neural
  architectures such as normalizing flows. We show that our approach compares
  favorably to the state of the art in a variety of settings, including perfect
  and imperfect interventions for which the targeted nodes may even be unknown.
