title: "Exploring Assumptions for Identifiability using Differentiable Causal Discovery Methods"
abstract: "Causal inference holds great promise for understanding real-world systems, but its success hinges on the assumptions we make. In this talk, I explore how differentiable causal discovery methods can serve as flexible tools for causal discovery. I show a practical example applied to climate data where causal representation learning is used. Another key idea is the introduction of typing assumptionsâ€”the idea that variables belong to semantic types, and that causal relations are constrained by these types. This perspective provides a structured way to encode domain knowledge and improves the identifiability of causal models in applied settings."
